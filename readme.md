# Time Donuts
### A simple tool to see if it's OK to call a certain part of the world

It simply shows red/yellow/green for the time of day. The donuts rotate counter-clockwise and show whether it's OK to call or not.

In its current form, this project is still a proof-of-concept. The goal is to create a pure HTML5/JavaScript page that allows a user to select a few timezones/countries and then bookmark a permalink to the page. The permalink will automatically populate the page with the user's clocks.
